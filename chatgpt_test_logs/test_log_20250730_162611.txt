[Question 37/40] How long can I stay in the UK with the Uk Family Visa?
Fetching ChatGPT response...
ChatGPT response: The duration of stay in the UK with a UK Family Visa depends on the specific circumstances and the type of family relationship you have with someone who is a UK resident. Here are the general guidelines for different scenarios:

1. **Partner or Spouse**:
   - If you are applying as a spouse or partner (including fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner), you can initially stay for 33 months if applying from outside the UK or 30 months if applying from within the UK. You can then apply to extend your stay for another 30 months, which can lead to eligibility for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after a total of 5 years.

2. **Children**:
   - Children can stay as long as their parent's visa is valid. They can apply for extensions and eventually settle in the UK after 5 years, similar to adult partners.

3. **Adult Dependent Relative**:
   - This visa usually allows for permanent stay from the outset, as it is intended for family members who need long-term care.

4. **Other Relatives**:
   - Other relatives who need long-term care and cannot get such care in their home country might also be eligible to stay permanently.

Each type of Family Visa has specific conditions and durations, so it's essential to check the exact type of visa and the associated rules for your particular situation.
