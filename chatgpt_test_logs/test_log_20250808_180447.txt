[Question 6/31] What are the financial requirements for applying as a partner or spouse?
Fetching ChatGPT response...
ChatGPT response: To apply for a UK partner or spouse visa, you must meet the financial requirement to show you can support yourselves without needing public funds. As of 2024, the financial requirements are:

**Minimum income threshold:**
- £18,600 per year if applying as a partner without children.

- An additional £2,400 for each additional child.

**Sources of income that can be used:**

- Non-employment income (e.g., rental income, dividends).
- Cash savings over £16,000 (must have been held for at least 6 months).
- Pension income.

**Savings can be used to meet the requirement** if income is below the threshold. The formula is:
- (Total savings - £16,000) ÷ 2.5 = amount that can be counted toward the income requirement.

**Exemptions:**
If the sponsor receives certain disability-related benefits, the financial requirement is different, and you must show "adequate maintenance" instead of meeting the income threshold.
